# First Landing Page
I'm learning HTML/CSS and currently building my first landing page.
You can have a look [here, on my Github.io Page.](https://hlmhc79.github.io/First-Landing-Page/)

### **_April 24th, 2022:_**
Version 2
- The videos open in a pop-up window. Still not what I have in mind but it's a start!
- Contact form styled

##### What I still want to do:
- Make the page responsive
- Modify the popup window


### **_April 24th, 2022:_**
Version 1

##### What I'm going to improve as I learn:
  - I haven't made this page responsive; for now it looks best on a desktop (1700x780)
  - I want the thumbnails video to open in a popup on the same page
  - The Contact form needs to be styled
