# First Landing Page
I'm learning HTML/CSS and currently building my first landing page.

**_April 24th, 2022:_**
Version 1

### What I'm going to improve as I learn:
  - I haven't made this page responsive; for now it looks best on a desktop (1700x780)
  - I want the thumbnails video to open in a popup on the same page
  - The Contact form needs to be styled
